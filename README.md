# OVERVIEW

Super Store is a ficional global retail store that has a lot of customers.
The Marketing Department would like to segment customers into groups using RFM analysis to be able to plan suitable marketing strategies. 
They would like to know which groups they should focus on to boost sales performance.

I used pandas to analyze the dataset and used Matplotlib, Seaborn to create some visualizations that may be able to help Marketing Department answer their questions.
I also gave some insights and recommendations to Marketing Department based on the analysis, as can be found in the .ipynb file.
